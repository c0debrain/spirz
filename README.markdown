[Spirz.com](http://spirz.com) is a social new web application built by Thomas-Antoine O'Neill and Alexandre Tristan St-Cyr in Java GWT for AppEngine.

Spirz is now powered by [Highway](http://github.com/taoneill/highway). Check out the Spirz code if you want to learn how to use Highway.

The first version of Spirz was finished in April 2010 as the result of a semester-long project at Concordia University, Montreal. Head to the [downloads section](http://github.com/taoneill/spirz/downloads) to find the final deliverable for the project which covers the site's specification and design.
