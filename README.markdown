[Spirz.com](http://spirz.com) is a social new website inspired by reddit. It was built by Thomas-Antoine O'Neill and Alexandre Tristan St-Cyr.

The website was built in Java GWT and is hosted on AppEngine.

Spirz is now powered by [Highway](http://github.com/taoneill/highway), and was the basis for that project's inception. Check out the Spirz code if you want to learn how to use Highway.

The first version of Spirz was finished in April 2010 as the result of a semester-long project at Concordia University. The document which can be found in the [downloads section](http://github.com/taoneill/spirz/downloads) was the final deliverable for the school project and covers most of the specification and design concerns of the projet.
